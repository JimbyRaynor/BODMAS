# make displaymath1,2 = ? initially and then update
# have fruit bonuses (max 100) to have some "7Seconds" strategy
# levels 1 to 10 have lots of simple instructions.
# ->> Real BODMAS/ALGEBRA starts at level 11 
# look at Algebra Tutorial 1
# plut +- signs in stationary bubbles, like bubble bobble.
# collecting things (numbers, fruit) is fun
# GOAL: get highest possible score
# build tools for LHS (level editor, etc)
# make a level inside a giant 3
# collect A, B, etc to evaluate A, B ,etc
# enemies chase car
# computer player also collects items: have two +s, one for each player. Race to finish first
# add math animation in background for each symbol of walls
#       Same activity for 100 levels would be boring
#       -> Need new activities for Maths
# Mention this is easier to read than the equivalent 2+(3*7), and esp. expressions like 1+(1+(1+1)) 
# Show how to evaluate nested brackets : 3*(1+(2/3))  read first ) then go left to first (
# distributive law a*(b+c) = a*b + a*c to simplify
# have fruit pickups to increase score
# score is increased per remaining time
# each level solves an equation. Show animation. Drive over steps in correct order, o/w fail.
# create lots of libraries to shorten code
# design levels that remove blocks after "+" is collected so that all collections are automatically in order
#  i.e. enclose second "+" completely in blocks
# first try succesful bonus score
# help student memorise formulas/methods
# did you know? at end of each section
# have fuel/ pick up fuel? Go slow if run out of fuel

# execute CPU instructions to run program?
